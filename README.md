# Fa-250-Workshop-2
## Simple crying animation using extra functions.

The canvas shows the text "click to see me cry", once clicked it shows an image of a figure, a single teardrop falls slowly to the ground, after 5 seconds a broken heart appears in the chest of the figure, then the canvas resets.

Below are and before and after images.

I primarily used vsCode for this sketch, though I did use the p5.js web editor for making the heart in the end.
I struggled a lot with this sketch, especially with figuring out the newly introduced functions, and ended up using a few boolean variables to make things easier.

I'm mostly happy with the result as it is interactive and able to tell a sort of story unlike the more basic shapes of my previous sketches.
I would like to become proficient enough to create more complex sketches more visually and in terms of interaction.

I did use chatGPT to help me place my setInterval and setTimeout functions as I had a lot of trouble with the program glitching or elements just not showing on the canvas due to misplacing functions.
